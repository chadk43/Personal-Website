# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### Contact 

Will send me an email directly. If there is no feedback it means I am currently out of tokens and once my api tokens are refreshed the email functionality will work once again.
